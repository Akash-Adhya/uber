# An Open-Source UBER Clone with *Leaflet* & *OpenStreetMap* Integration

This project is a full-stack ride-hailing app inspired by Uber, built with modern web technologies. A key distinction is the use of open-source mapping tools â€” OpenStreetMap and Leaflet â€” instead of Google Maps, making it free, flexible, and community-powered.
